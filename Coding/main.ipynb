    "### 1.4 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "For our implementation we will be using finite difference method for defining the spatial derivatives and RK4 for the time stepping / evolution. The code is available in [Github](linktoGithub).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.1 Spatial derivative\n",
    "\n",
    "The spatial derivatives are calculated using the finite difference method. here, we are using 6th order finite difference method for the spatial derivatives. The 6th order finite difference method is given by:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d f}{d x} = \\frac{1}{60\\delta x}\\left( - f_{i-3} + 9f_{i-2} - 45f_{i-1} + 45f_{i+1} - 9f_{i+2} + f_{i+3} \\right) $$\n",
    "$$ \\frac{d^2 f}{d x^2} = \\frac{1}{180\\delta x^2}\\left( 2f_{i-3} - 27f_{i-2} + 270f_{i-1} - 490f_{i} + 270f_{i+1} - 27f_{i+2} + 2f_{i+3} \\right) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Other orders can be used and is available for use in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of obtaining smooth derivatives as well for the sake of maintaining the boundary conditions, we use `ghost zones`. By default, 'relative anti-symmetric' ghost zones are used where the ghost cell at $i$ distance away from boundary $b$ is given by:\n",
    "$$ f_{b-i} = 2f_{b} - f_{b+i} \\quad \\text{at the start of the spatial domain} $$\n",
    "$$ f_{b+i} = 2f_{b} - f_{b-i} \\quad \\text{at the end of the spatial domain} $$\n",
    "where $i = 1, 2, 3, ..., n$ ($n$ is the half the order of the finite difference method).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other ghost zones types, such as 'symmetric' and 'anti-symmetric' can also be used and is available for use in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the 6th order finite difference method and 'relative anti-symmetric' ghost zones, a following magnetic field and the spatial derivatives are obtained (test case):\n",

    "![First spatial derivative](\\figures\\first_spatial_derivative.png)\n",
    "![Second spatial derivative](\\figures\\second_spatial_derivative.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see the spatial derivatives are smooth and the second derivative is zero at the boundaries as expected from the 'relative anti-symmetric' ghost zones. This works exceptionally well for the $z$ implementation. For the $r$ implementation, the ghost zones cannot help much in keeping the boundary conditions constant as the equation contains first and second derivatives as well as the function itself. Hence, the boundary conditions are not maintained well in the $r$ implementation. This is a known issue and is being worked on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.4.2 RK4 time stepping\n",
    "\n",
    "The time stepping is done using the RK4 method. Our evolution function can be given of form:\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial \\overline B}{\\partial t} = f(\\overline B, t) $$\n",
    "Then, the RK4 method evolution for a single time step can be given by:\n",
    "$$ \\kappa_1 = \\delta t f(\\overline B, t) $$\n",
    "$$ \\kappa_2 = \\delta t f(\\overline B + \\frac{\\kappa_1}{2}, t + \\frac{\\delta t}{2}) $$\n",
    "$$ \\kappa_3 = \\delta t f(\\overline B + \\frac{\\kappa_2}{2}, t + \\frac{\\delta t}{2}) $$\n",
    "$$ \\kappa_4 = \\delta t f(\\overline B + k_3, t + \\delta t) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\overline B(t + \\delta t) = \\overline B(t) + \\frac{1}{6}(\\kappa_1 + 2\\kappa_2 + 2\\kappa_3 + \\kappa_4) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing to note here about the generalized form, with regards to the RK4 method, is that:\n",
    "- The spatial derivatives do not change values with the change ($\\overline B \\rightarrow \\overline B + \\kappa/2$) in the RK4 method. This is due to the symmetry of the spatial derivative equations. Hence, the spatial derivatives are calculated only once at the start of the time step. Thus, it is not mentioned in the equation form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our method, as mentioned above, is to find the spatial derivatives using finite difference method at a certain time step and then use the RK4 method to evolve the system to the next time step. This is done repetitively to get the solution at all time steps."
