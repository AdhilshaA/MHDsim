This website follows the updates on my project on MHD. The project is about the `study of the Galactic Dynamos`. 

## Abstract


Studying `galactic mean-field dynamos` involves exploring the intricate dynamics governing cosmic magnetic fields, which provide invaluable insights into the formation and evolution of galaxies. Our research focuses on understanding the `impact of vertical outflows` within these systems, as they greatly influence the distribution of gas and magnetic fields within galaxies and are crucial to the star formation rates and matter-energy transport processes. In this study, our objective was to investigate how vertical outflows, characterized by various velocity profiles, influence the evolution of galactic magnetic fields. 

Utilizing a combination of finite differencing and RK4 methods, we simulated the kinematic regime to observe the behavior of magnetic fields over time. Our findings demonstrate that the incorporation of velocity outflows, particularly stronger ones, `hinders the growth of magnetic fields`, and in some cases, even leads to decay. This highlights the significant role that vertical outflows play in `shaping the evolution of magnetic fields` in galactic dynamos, particularly emphasizing their interaction with radial terms.

These insights can not only deepen our understanding of the dynamics of galactic magnetic fields but also contribute to broader discussions surrounding galaxy formation. By studying the intricate interplay between various physical processes within cosmic structures, this project sheds light on aspects of galactic evolution that are closer to our comprehension of the universe's complex mechanisms.
